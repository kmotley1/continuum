Continuum is a desktop study environment designed for pastors who want to plan and prepare sermons without the friction of context switching. It merges Logos Bible Software with AI in one seamless interface — giving pastors the focus, speed, and organization they need to move from study to sermon.

1. Core Problem to Solve

Context-Switching: Pastors research deeply in Logos (commentaries, cross-references, original languages) but then toggle to ChatGPT for brainstorming outlines, illustrations, and simplification. The back-and-forth costs time and focus.

Fragmented Workflow: Copy-pasting between tools is tedious and interrupts the creative flow.

Distraction Risk: Switching windows and reformatting outputs makes sermon prep feel scattered, especially under weekly time pressure.


2. Continuum’s 3-Panel Study Flow

Left Panel: Sermon Planner

Organized by Sunday dates and sermon series, giving pastors a structured view of upcoming services.

Context awareness means when a pastor clicks on a Sunday, Continuum “knows” the relevant series and past notes.

Acts as the organizational backbone that ties research and AI conversations into a single timeline.

Middle Panel: Logos Environment

The Logos web app runs here, letting pastors highlight verses, commentaries, or original language notes.

Highlights can be passed directly into AI with one keystroke.

Right Panel: AI Workspace

This is the pastor’s own ChatGPT account (authenticated directly, not resold).

AI receives context from Logos highlights or planner notes automatically.

Pastors can ask:

“Summarize this commentary in 3 points for my sermon.”

“Give me illustration ideas for this passage.”

“Remind me what I drafted for last week’s sermon intro.”


3. Technical Clarification

No new AI model. Continuum simply provides a bridge between Logos and the pastor’s existing ChatGPT session.

Bridge Layer: Hotkeys and shortcuts pass text, verses, or notes into ChatGPT instantly.

Lightweight Desktop App: Functions as a consistent, distraction-free workspace instead of two disconnected browser tabs.



4. Positioning

Continuum is not just a wrapper. It’s:

A context-aware sermon workspace that remembers the relationship between Sundays, sermon series, and study notes.

A focus tool that eliminates the friction of juggling Logos and AI separately.

A trusted layer that leaves control in the pastor’s hands (they use their own Logos and their own OpenAI accounts).
