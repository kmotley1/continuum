SUBJECT: Continuum - Sermon Study App for Testing

Hi Pastor,

I've built a desktop app called "Continuum" that combines sermon planning, note-taking, Logos Bible Software, and AI assistance into one integrated environment. I'd love for you to test it out and give me feedback!

üöÄ WHAT IS CONTINUUM?
- A desktop app that combines Logos Bible Software, ChatGPT, and note-taking
- Calendar-based sermon planning
- Rich text notes with export options
- "Send to Chat" functionality to get AI help with your study
- All integrated in one window

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is an updated version that fixes layout issues on Windows!

üì¶ HOW TO GET IT:
I'll share both versions via:
1. Google Drive/Dropbox link (preferred)
2. WeTransfer link 
3. Or I can mail you a USB drive

üõ†Ô∏è INSTALLATION:

FOR WINDOWS USERS (Surface Pro, PC, etc.):
- File: "Continuum Setup 1.0.0.exe" (140MB)
- Download and double-click the .exe file to run the installer
- Follow the installation wizard (just click "Next" through the steps)
- Launch "Continuum" from your Start Menu or desktop shortcut
- If Windows Defender warns ‚Üí Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway" (security feature)

FOR MAC USERS (MacBook, iMac, etc.):
- File: "Continuum-Test.zip" (272MB)
- Download and double-click to unzip
- Drag "Continuum.app" to your Applications folder
- Open from Applications or Spotlight search
- If macOS says "app can't be opened" ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Open (security feature)

üîí DATA ISOLATION:
- Each user gets their own separate data folder
- No shared accounts or login required
- Your notes are completely separate from mine
- No internet required for basic functionality

‚ú® FEATURES TO TEST:
1. **Calendar/Planner**: Click "Calendar" button to open sermon planning
2. **Notes**: Click "Notes" button to open the note editor
3. **Logos Integration**: If you have Logos, it should load automatically
4. **AI Chat**: Click "Send to Chat" to send text to ChatGPT
5. **Export**: Download notes as PDF, Word, or Pages format

üîß WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
1. Does it install and run without issues?
2. Do the Logos and ChatGPT integrations work?
3. Is the interface intuitive?
4. Any features you'd like to see added?
5. Any bugs or crashes?

üì± SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Windows (any recent version) OR macOS (any recent version)
- Internet connection (for Logos and ChatGPT)
- Optional: Logos Bible Software account

üí¨ FEEDBACK:
Please let me know:
- What works well
- What's confusing
- What's missing
- Any suggestions for improvement

This is still in development, so I'm looking for real-world feedback from actual pastors like yourself. Your input would be incredibly valuable!

Thanks for taking the time to test this out. Let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues.

Blessings,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The app is completely free to use and doesn't collect any personal data. It's just a tool to help with sermon preparation and study.

TECHNICAL NOTES:
